This VBA script loops through each worksheet of a spreadsheet containing stock information for each year and outputs the following information:

    * The ticker symbol.
    * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    * Positive yearly change will be highlighted in green versus negative change in red
    * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    * The total stock volume of the stock.

The script will also output the following information for each year:

    * The ticker symbol with the greatest percentage increase and its value
    * The ticker symbol with the greatest percentage decrease and its value
    * The ticker smybol with the greatest total volume and its value
